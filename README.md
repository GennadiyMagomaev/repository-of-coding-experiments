## There are two basic workflows implemented here with two scenarios:

1. When changes occur from local to remote repository (should be prefixed with "`feature`" of your branch name):
- check eslint
- test check
- build application


2. When merging a remote feature branch into the main branch:
- check eslint
- test check
- build application
- deploy application

Additionally, each workflow includes:
- npm caching
- dependency caching
